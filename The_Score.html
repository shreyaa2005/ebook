        <p> He knows how to score, on and off the ice...
</p>

<p>Allie Hayes is in crisis mode. With graduation looming, she still doesnâ€™t have the first clue about what she's going to do after college. To make matters worse, sheâ€™s nursing a broken heart thanks to the end of her longtime relationship. Wild rebound sex is definitely not the solution to her problems, but gorgeous hockey star Dean Di Laurentis is impossible to resist. Just once, though, because even if her future is uncertain, it sure as heck wonâ€™t include the king of one-night stands.</p>

<p>Itâ€™ll take more than flashy moves to win her over...</p>

<p>Dean always gets what he wants. Girls, grades, girls, recognition, girlsâ€¦heâ€™s a ladies man, all right, and heâ€™s yet to meet a woman whoâ€™s immune to his charms. Until Allie. For one night, the feisty blonde rocked his entire worldâ€”and now she wants to be friends? Nope. Itâ€™s not over until he says itâ€™s over. Dean is in full-on pursuit, but when life-rocking changes strike, he starts to wonder if maybe itâ€™s time to stop focusing on scoringâ€¦and shoot for love.
