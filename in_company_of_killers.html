Inside the tony suburb of Scarsdale is New Yorkâ€™s worst-kept secret: The mob runs everything, and the Nicastro family is at the center. Seventeen-year-old Tasha Nicastro lives a life of glitz and glamour, but she has no idea her family harbors a dark truth.</p>

<p>Tasha might look like your classic high school mean girl, but behind the designer clothes is a sharpshooter who knows how to bring anyone to their knees. The only person who has ever gotten under her skin is her former best friend, Leo Danesi, the youngest son of the Nicastro familyâ€™s rivals. After Leo returns to New York older and more handsome, Tasha thinks heâ€™ll be the worst of her problemsâ€”until the life she thought she knew takes a violent, shocking turn. When her father and beloved older sister are murdered before her eyes, Tasha learns the dark truth: Her family runs the most powerful Mafia branch in New York, and now sheâ€™s set to inherit it all.</p>

<p>Tasha vows vengeance on the mysterious new mob behind the hit, but she canâ€™t do it alone. She needs someone who already knows the underground world to help track them down. And that person is none other than Leo, the heir to his own familyâ€™s dangerous empire.</p>

<p>But Tasha is a Nicastro. Sheâ€™s been raised in the company of killers, and thereâ€™s absolutely nothing she wonâ€™t do to avenge her family. That is, if the enemy doesnâ€™t put her in gold chains first.</p>
