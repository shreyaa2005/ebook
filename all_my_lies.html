        <p>A lie might hurt, but the truth can kill.</p>
        <p>All I ever wanted was to write a bestseller. And now, finally, Iâ€™ve done it. People ask me how, where did I get my inspiration?</p>
        <p>But I can never tell them â€“ because I have a secret.</p>
        <p>No one knows what I did. Not my beloved husband or my busybody mother. And nobody can ever find outâ€”it would destroy my career and I'd lose everything. Including my precious baby.</p>
        <p>Then the threats begin.</p>
        <p>The ominous emails, the sinister letters, and the chilling gifts left outside my door by someone who knows the truth. Someone whoâ€™s stalking me and wants to make me pay for my sins. I must do whatever it takes to silence them.</p>
        <p>They say youâ€™re only as good as your last book. I know youâ€™re only as good as your next lie.</p>
